## 2024-01-09: Lead-to-Client Conversion Implementation

### Feature: Automated Lead-to-Client Conversion

Implemented a comprehensive workflow for converting leads to clients when their process status changes to completed.

#### Changes Made:
1. Lead Conversion Workflow
   - Added automatic conversion trigger when lead status changes to completed
   - Implemented user confirmation dialog
   - Created pre-filled client form with lead data
   - Added proper database insertion with organization context

2. Data Handling
   - Preserved all lead metadata in client creation
   - Added timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt) in metadata
   - Included organization ID in both client and timeline events
   - Maintained lead reference in client entity

3. Technical Improvements
   - Fixed client database insertion using FirebaseClientsRepository
   - Added proper organization ID validation
   - Improved error handling and user feedback
   - Added comprehensive logging

#### Files Modified:
- `lib/presentation/pages/leads/leads_page.dart`
  * Added convertLeadToClient method
  * Updated _updateLeadProcessStatus
  * Fixed ClientsBloc initialization

#### Testing Notes:
- Verify client appears in Firebase after conversion
- Check timeline events for both lead and client
- Ensure all metadata is properly transferred
- Test error scenarios (missing org ID, conversion cancellation)
