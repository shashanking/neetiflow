# UI
 in leads page we will have csv file upload option and manual uploading option for addition of leads in database. 

it will have a table which will be paginated and show the leads data.

when we upload a csv file it will be added in the table in real time 
these leads will go in organizaion collection - leads collection - leadslist id . 
we should be able to create multiple leadslist and add leads to them.
