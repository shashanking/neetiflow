# Launch Screen Assets

You can customize the launch screen with your own desired assets by replacing the image files in this directory.

You can also do it by opening your Flutter project's Xcode project with `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, selecting `Runner/Assets.xcassets` in the Project Navigator and dropping in the desired images.

## Current Launch Screen
The current launch screen displays the NeetiFlow logo with a clean, minimal design that follows Material Design 3 guidelines. The screen uses dynamic colors that adapt to the system's light/dark mode settings.

## Customization Guidelines
1. Image Requirements:
   - Provide @1x, @2x, and @3x versions
   - Use PNG format for best quality
   - Keep file sizes optimized
   - Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines

2. Supported Orientations:
   - Portrait
   - Landscape (if enabled in app settings)

3. Safe Areas:
   - Ensure content respects safe areas
   - Test on different device sizes
   - Account for notches and dynamic islands
